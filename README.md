## Core Features

### Intelligent Rotation
- **Level-sync awareness** - Abilities adjust to your current level
- **Resource management** - Lily, Aetherflow, Kenki, Heat, and all job gauges
- **oGCD weaving** - Optimal ability timing without clipping
- **Positional indicator** - Real-time rear/flank/front display for melee DPS, updating as your combo progresses; suppressed automatically when True North is active or target is immune
- **Smart AoE targeting** - Directional AoE abilities (Howling Fist, Chain Saw, Bioblaster, etc.) automatically target the enemy that hits the most targets
- **Proc tracking** - Never waste a proc or let buffs fall off
- **Auto-attack start** - Optional setting to begin the rotation as soon as your weapon is drawn, rather than waiting for the first GCD

### Fight Timeline Integration
- **Raidwide prediction** - Pre-shield and pre-heal before damage hits
- **Tankbuster awareness** - Mitigations timed for incoming hits
- **Phase tracking** - Adapts to fight phases and mechanics
- **Arcadion Savage support** - Full timeline data for current tier

### Party Coordination (IPC)
When multiple party members use Olympus, they coordinate automatically:

| Coordination Type | What It Does |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **Heal Coordination** | Prevents double-healing the same target |
| **AOE Heal Sync** | Staggers party heals to avoid overlap |
| **Mitigation Stacking** | Prevents wasting Divine Veil + Temperance together |
| **Raise Coordination** | Only one healer raises each dead player |
| **Burst Windows** | DPS align raid buffs for maximum damage |
| **Tank Swaps** | Coordinated Provoke/Shirk sequences |
| **Interrupt Priority** | One player per interruptible cast |

### Visual Overlay (Draw Helper)
An optional in-game overlay to aid positioning and range awareness:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Attack Range Rings** | Melee and ranged attack ranges displayed as rings around your character, fading when comfortably in range |
| **Enemy Hitboxes** | Targeted enemy hitbox drawn on screen for precise distance judgement |
| **Positional Zones** | Rear, flank, and front zones shown on your target so you can see exactly where to stand |

Toggle and appearance options available in **Settings → Draw Helper**.

### Performance Analytics
- **Real-time metrics** - GCD uptime, deaths, near-deaths during combat
- **Post-fight scoring** - Letter grades (S/A/B/C/D) with breakdown
- **Downtime analysis** - Categorizes lost GCDs (movement, death, mechanics)
- **Cooldown tracking** - Drift detection and missed opportunity alerts
- **Session history** - Track improvement over multiple fights
- **FFLogs integration** - Compare your performance to community parses

### Training Mode
Transform from passenger to pilot with intelligent coaching:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Live Explanations** | See *why* each ability is chosen in real-time |
| **Real-Time Hints** | In-combat coaching tips for struggling concepts |
| **Decision Validation** | Instant feedback: optimal (✓), acceptable (≈), or suboptimal (✗) |
| **Coaching Personality** | 4 feedback styles: Encouraging, Analytical, Strict, Silent |
| **Spaced Repetition** | Knowledge retention tracking with forgetting curves |

## Installation

### Dev Plugin (this fork — MyOlympus)
1. Build the project (output contains `MyOlympus.dll` + `MyOlympus.json`)
2. In-game: `/xlsettings` → **Experimental** → **Dev Plugin Locations**
3. Add the build output folder
4. `/xlplugins` → enable **MyOlympus**

This fork uses InternalName `MyOlympus` so it can sit beside the official Olympus plugin without colliding.
